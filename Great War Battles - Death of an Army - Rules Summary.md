# Great War Battles - Death of an Army - Rules Summary

## Open Issues

### What players need to remember

* Saved British Replacement Steps
* ARTY that fired Counter Battery Fire
* ARTY suppressed by Counter Battery Fire
* Units that have attacked
* ARTY that has barraged
* Units that participated in Coordinated Combat
* Units that forced march

### Changes to the Rules

* Counter Battery Fire may occur at any point during Coordinated Combat, but since it only makes sense before you have declared any combats, I've moved it before.

### Questions

* If all units cannot retreat, do you still reduce step losses?
* When backing up a unit from harassing fire, what if THAT hex is now over stacked?
* Clarification: Can units without a divisional designation stack with units from 1 division?
* Can two units AAO advance into the same hex if they comply with stacking limits? Or does the first one that advances render that intervening hex no longer vacant?
* Does the Samson Armored Car Group exert a ZOC?
* Assumption: Army/Corp ARTY never has LOS to the Target Hex.

## Definition of Terms

### Army Demoralization

* No army demoralization in __Death of an Army__

### Artillery (ARTY) Units

* Status:
  * DEPLOYED: Counter is face up, showing 0 MA.
    * __Firing over Open Sights__:
      * ARTY with a combat strength > 0 on their LIMBERED side may fire as if it is on its DEPLOYED side.
      * Has a 2 hex range.
  * LIMBERED: Counter is face down.
* All ARTY  units have a single step.
* Army/Corps ARTY:
  * Place in the off board artillery box.
  * Does not move.
  * Face up: May fire.
  * Face down: Has already fired this turn.
  * May not fire in __Defensive__ or __Harassing Fire__.

### British Infantry Brigades

* British infantry brigades have 3 steps.
* The final step is a cadre-sized unit.

### Disorganized

* Place a __D1__ marker on a unit not already marked DISORGANIZED that receives a Disorganized result receives.
* For each additional Disorganized result, replace with a marker 1 level higher.

### Lines of Communication (LOC)

* LOC is a path __from__ a friendly board edge or supply source __to__ a unit. _(The actual wording in the rule book is the opposite, but given the effect of unbridged rivers or canals, this makes more sense.)_
* May not be traced through an Uncontested EZOC.
* May cross an unbridged river or canal, but extends only to the hex immediately on the other side.
* The eastern boards edge is friendly to the Germans, western to the Allies.

### Line of Sight (LOS)

* Traced from hex center to hex center.
* LOS is blocked if it goes through a woods or village/city symbol (not hex) in any of the intervening hexes.
* Also blocked if it goes through high ground symbol (not hex), while both firing and Target Hexes are on not in a hex containing a high ground symbol.

### Zones of Control (ZOC)

* 6 hexes surrounding a unit.
  * Does not extend across an unbridged river, canal, lake, or moat hexside.
* Only non-ARTY units exert a ZOC.
* A __Contested ZOC__ is one that contains a unit from the other side.
* A unit is considered to be in an __Uncontested EZOC__ if it is the only friendly unit in that hex when it tries to do something that could be restricted by Uncontested EZOCs (e.g., leave the hex).
